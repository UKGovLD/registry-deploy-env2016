# registry-deploy-env2016

This is a customization of registry-config-base for the 2016 release of the Defra Environment registry.

Should set upstream to enable changes to be pulled in:

    git remote add upstream git@github.com:UKGovLD/registry-config-base.git

## Installation

While this includes the `install` and `scripts` areas they are not used, this is deployed using a separate chef cookbook.
